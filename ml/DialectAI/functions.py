    Computes and returns an element-wise dropout mask for a given tensor, where
    each element in the mask is dropped out with probability dropout_probability.
    Note that the mask is NOT applied to the tensor - the tensor is passed to retain
    the correct CUDA tensor type for the mask.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dropout_probability : float, required.
        Probability of dropping a dimension of the input.
    tensor_for_masking : torch.Tensor, required.


    Returns
    -------
    A torch.FloatTensor consisting of the binary mask scaled by 1/ (1 - dropout_probability).
    This scaling ensures expected values and variances of the output of applying this mask
     and the original tensor are the same.

    An initializer which allows initializing model parameters in "blocks". This is helpful
    in the case of recurrent models which use multiple gates applied to linear projections,
    which can be computed efficiently if they are concatenated together. However, they are
    separate parameters which should be initialized independently.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor : ``torch.Tensor``, required.
        A tensor to initialize.
    split_sizes : List[int], required.
        A list of length ``tensor.ndim()`` specifying the size of the
        blocks along that particular dimension. E.g. ``[10, 20]`` would
        result in the tensor being split into chunks of size 10 along the
